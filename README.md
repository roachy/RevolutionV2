An openSource engine for a text based Mafia RPG, using PHP and SQL.

Please excuse the fucking state of the code, I know it's disgusting. I only ever added features to this as it was based off the
MCcodes RPG framework.

If you wanna actively develop it, feel free. I practically abandoned this as a project, but
it would be very encouraging to see someone else taking an interest in it.
